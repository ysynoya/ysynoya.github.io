<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I work at Shanghai University of Sport as a lecturer teaching data science.

I am now working on mega sport events' sustainability and urban environment for sport and fitness using multi-source data. If you are seeking any form of academic coorperation, please feel free to email me at [yusiyi@sus.edu.cn](mailto:yusiyi@sus.edu.cn). Students who are interested in data science in sport events and public service system for sports and fitness are also welcome to apply for a master's degree.

I received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Cartography and Geographic Information System from East China Normal University, advised by Bailang Yu (余柏蒗) and Jianping Wu (吴健平).

My research interest includes statictical modelling on spatial data targeting urban issues.
