<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I work at Shanghai University of Sport as a lecturer teaching data science.

I am now working on mega sports events' sustainability and urban environment for sports and fitness using multi-source data. If you are seeking any form of academic cooperation, please feel free to email me at [yusiyi@sus.edu.cn](mailto:yusiyi@sus.edu.cn). Students who are interested in data science in sports events and the public service system for sports and fitness are also welcome to apply for a master's degree.

I received the B.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Cartography and Geographic Information System from East China Normal University, advised by Bailang Yu (‰ΩôÊüèËíó) and Jianping Wu (Âê¥ÂÅ•Âπ≥), respectively.

My research interest includes statistical modelling on spatial data targeting urban issues.
